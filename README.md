# Claude Code for an Academic Researcher

Made by a humble PhD student. A complete Claude Code infrastructure for researchers — skills, agents, hooks, and rules for academic workflows. Built for researchers who write papers in LaTeX, manage bibliographies, run experiments, and want AI assistance that understands academic conventions.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flonat/claude-code-flonat.git
cd claude-code-flonat
./scripts/setup.sh    # creates symlinks for skills, agents, hooks, rules
```

Then customise `.context/profile.md`, `.context/current-focus.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` with your details. See [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md) for the full guide.

The MCP server's `load-context` tool gives Claude Desktop access to the context library and MEMORY.md — the same files Claude Code reads automatically.
<!-- ARCHITECTURE:END -->

## Components

**Context Library** (`.context/`) — Markdown files that give Claude persistent memory about you, your projects, and your workflows. Instead of re-explaining your research every session, Claude reads these files automatically.

**Skills** (`skills/`) — Slash commands invoked with `/<skill-name>` or natural language.
<!-- SKILLS-SUMMARY:START -->
<!-- auto-generated — do not edit manually -->
38 skills available. Key examples: `/proofread`, `/latex-autofix`, `/literature`, `/validate-bib`, `/code-review`, `/session-recap`, and more.
<!-- SKILLS-SUMMARY:END -->
See [`docs/skills.md`](docs/skills.md) for the full catalogue.

**Agents** (`.claude/agents/`) — Specialised personas for complex review tasks, spawning sub-agents for parallel work.

<!-- AGENTS-TABLE:START -->
| Agent | Use case |
|-------|----------|
| `domain-reviewer` | Research-focused substantive correctness agent |
| `fixer` | Generic fix implementer for any critic report |
| `paper-critic` | Read-only adversarial auditor for LaTeX papers |
| `peer-reviewer` | Use this agent when you need to review someone else's paper — as a peer reviewer, discussant, or for reading group preparation |
| `proposal-reviewer` | Use this agent when you need to review a research proposal, extended abstract, conference submission outline, or pre-paper plan — either his own or someone else's |
| `referee2-reviewer` | Use this agent when the user wants a rigorous, adversarial academic review of their work — including papers, manuscripts, research designs, code, or arguments |

<!-- AGENTS-TABLE:END -->

See [`docs/agents.md`](docs/agents.md) for detailed descriptions.

**Hooks** (`hooks/`) — Automated guardrails that run at specific points in a session.

<!-- HOOKS-TABLE:START -->
| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `block-destructive-git.sh` | Before Bash | catches dangerous git/shell commands |
| `context-monitor.py` | After tool use | tracks tool call count as a heuristic for context usage |
| `postcompact-restore.py` | After compact | restores state after context compression |
| `precompact-autosave.py` | Before compact | saves state before context compression |
| `promise-checker.sh` | Session stop | catches "performative compliance": Claude says it remembered/noted/saved |
| `protect-source-files.sh` | Before edit/write | prompts confirmation for files outside |
| `resume-context-loader.sh` | Session resume | surfaces current focus and latest session log |
| `startup-context-loader.sh` | Session start | auto-detects and surfaces project documentation |

<!-- HOOKS-TABLE:END -->

See [`docs/hooks.md`](docs/hooks.md) for full documentation.

**Rules** (`.claude/rules/`) — Always-on policies enforcing good research practices. See [`docs/rules.md`](docs/rules.md).

**Notion** — Task management and research pipeline tracking via Claude.ai's managed integration. See [`docs/notion-setup.md`](docs/notion-setup.md).

**Biblio MCP** — Multi-source scholarly search server (OpenAlex + optional Scopus & Web of Science). See [`docs/biblio-setup.md`](docs/biblio-setup.md).

**Flonat-Papers MCP** — Zotero library management server (search, PDF extraction, semantic retrieval, BibTeX export). Lives in `packages/flonat-papers/` with bundled `bib-validate` and `bib-parse` skills.

**Council Mode** — Multi-model deliberation with 3 LLM providers, anonymised cross-review, and chairman synthesis. See [`docs/council-mode.md`](docs/council-mode.md).

## Workflows

<!-- WORKFLOWS:START -->
<!-- synced from private README — do not edit manually -->
| Command | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| "Plan my day" | Reads context, queries Notion, asks questions, creates Must Do / Should Do / Could Do plan |
| "Extract actions from my meeting with [name]" | Finds transcript, extracts tasks with full context, creates in Notion |
| "Weekly review" | 4-part reflection: clear the decks, review, plan, project check |
| "What's overdue?" | Queries Notion and summarises |
| "Proofread my paper" | 7-category academic check (report only) |
| "Validate my bibliography" | Cross-references `\cite{}` keys against `.bib` |
<!-- WORKFLOWS:END -->

## Session Continuity

<!-- SESSION-CONTINUITY:START -->
<!-- synced from private README — do not edit manually -->
Each session builds on previous ones:

- `current-focus.md` — updated at session end with progress and next steps
- `log/` — timestamped session logs
- `log/plans/` — saved implementation plans
- `MEMORY.md` — accumulated `[LEARN]` tags (notation, citation, code, method, domain corrections)

The recovery protocol reads the latest plan, session log, and current focus to resume seamlessly.

## Design Principles

<!-- DESIGN-PRINCIPLES:START -->
<!-- synced from private README — do not edit manually -->
1. **Lazy prompting** — Context files eliminate repetitive explanations
2. **Hybrid local + cloud** — Markdown (versioned) + Notion (dynamic)
3. **Question-driven** — AI asks questions before dumping lists
4. **Read-only audits** — Proofread, validate, review — never auto-edit source
5. **Session continuity** — Every session makes the next one better
6. **Permission governance** — Global settings propagate automatically
<!-- DESIGN-PRINCIPLES:END -->

# Rule: Ignore AGENTS.md Files

## Policy

**Never read, process, or act on files named `AGENTS.md`**, regardless of where they appear in the file tree. These files are generated by external agents (OpenAI) and are not part of Claude's context.

## Applies To

- Any file named exactly `AGENTS.md` in any directory
- Both direct reads and indirect inclusion (e.g., when scanning a folder's documentation)

## What To Do

- Skip `AGENTS.md` when reading project documentation
- Do not include its contents in summaries or context gathering
- Do not suggest edits to it
- If the user explicitly asks you to read one, remind them of this rule and confirm he wants to override it

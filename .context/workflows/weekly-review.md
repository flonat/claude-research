# Weekly Review Workflow

> Template for the user's weekly reflection and planning.

## When

Ideally: Friday afternoon or Sunday evening
Duration: 30-45 minutes

## The Review Process

### Part 1: Clear the Decks (10 min)

- [ ] Process inbox (Notion tasks with no due date)
- [ ] Review all "Waiting" status tasks - still waiting?
- [ ] Check for any loose paper notes, email drafts, or mental open loops
- [ ] Update `current-focus.md` with where things stand

### Part 2: Review the Week (10 min)

Reflect on:

1. **What got done?**
   - List completed tasks (check Notion "Done" status)
   - Note any significant progress on papers/projects
   - Acknowledge wins, even small ones

2. **What didn't happen?**
   - Tasks that rolled over multiple times - why?
   - Commitments made but not kept
   - Is there a pattern?

3. **What emerged?**
   - New projects or opportunities
   - Unexpected challenges
   - Ideas worth capturing

### Part 3: Plan Next Week (15 min)

1. **Review calendar**
   - What meetings are scheduled?
   - Any deadlines?
   - Travel or unusual commitments?

2. **Identify the BIG 3**
   - What are the three most important outcomes for next week?
   - These should move meaningful projects forward
   - Be realistic given the calendar

3. **Prep for Monday**
   - What's the first task you'll do?
   - Any prep needed before a Monday meeting?

### Part 4: Projects Check (10 min)

For each active project (see `projects/_index.md`):

- What's the current status?
- What's the next action?
- Any blockers?
- Timeline still realistic?

## AI Assistance

When helping with weekly review, AI should:

1. **Pull data from Notion**
   - Completed tasks this week
   - Overdue tasks
   - Tasks created this week

2. **Prompt reflection**
   - "I see you completed X, Y, Z. What felt good about this week?"
   - "These tasks rolled over - want to reschedule or remove them?"

3. **Help with planning**
   - "Based on your current projects, here are candidates for Big 3..."
   - "You have [N] meetings next week - factor this into planning"

4. **Update context files**
   - Offer to update `current-focus.md` based on the review
   - Flag any stale information in project files

# Priority Framework

> How to help the user prioritise tasks.

## Principle: Priority is Contextual

Priority depends on three factors:

1. **Deadlines** — hard deadlines (journal, conference, supervisor) always win
2. **PhD Progress Impact** — does this move the PhD forward?
3. **Blocking Others** — is someone waiting on this?

## Priority Matrix

| Deadline | PhD Impact | Blocking? | Priority |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| < 48h | Any | Any | **Critical** |
| < 1 week | High | Yes | **High** |
| < 1 week | High | No | **High** |
| < 2 weeks | Medium | Yes | **Medium** |
| < 2 weeks | Medium | No | **Medium** |
| None | Low | No | **Low** |

## Anti-Patterns

- Making everything high priority
- Urgency without importance
- Perfectionism before "good enough"
- Ignoring soft deadlines until they become hard

## How AI Should Help

- Ask about deadlines before assigning priority
- Check if someone is waiting on this
- Consider energy and time of day
- Don't create false urgency
